Wordle is a web-based word game created and developed by Welsh software engineer Josh Wardle.
It was bought by the New York Times Company in 2022, who has since maintained and published it.
Players have six attempts to guess a five-letter word.
with feedback given for each guess in the form of colored tiles indicating when letters match or occupy the correct position.
The mechanics are nearly identical to the 1955 pen-and-paper game Jotto and the television game show franchise Lingo.
Wordle has a single daily solution, with all players attempting to guess the same word.
Wardle created the game for himself and his partner to play, eventually making it public in October 2021.
The game gained popularity in December 2021 after Wardle added the ability for players to copy their daily results as emoji squares. 
which were widely shared on Twitter.
Many clones and variations of the game were also created, as were versions in languages besides English.
The game was purchased by The New York Times Company in January 2022 for an undisclosed seven-figure sum.
with plans to keep it free for all players; it was moved to the company's website in February 2022.
