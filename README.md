Wordle is a web-based word game created and developed by Welsh software engineer Josh Wardle.
It was bought by the New York Times Company in 2022, who has since maintained and published it.
Players have six attempts to guess a five-letter word, with feedback given for each guess in the form of colored tiles indicating when letters match or occupy the correct position.
